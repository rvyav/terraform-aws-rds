# TERRAFORM - AWS RDS INSTANCE

Quick `RDS INSTANCE` instance example.

Currently, the infrastructure already has a VPC with two public subnets.

The goal is to:
- Create a `POSTGRES RDS` INSTANCE
- Manage the Security Group to get access to `RDS` instance
- Update the I AM ROLE for permissions
- Save the environment variables in `AWS SECRET MANAGER`
